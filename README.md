## 🎯 Problem Statement
*People today often lack emotional support, guidance, and expert advice in their daily lives. Many individuals cannot freely talk to their loved ones, or may not always have access to the right professionals when needed. This creates emotional gaps and delays in decision-making..*
* **Context: lack of emotional support** [Why is this a problem?]
* **Impact:helps in supporting emotionally** [Who suffers from this?]

## 💡 Solution
*My AI Companion Bot provides a single platform where users can talk to two types of intelligent assistants. The first section simulates emotional relationships like mother, father, brother, sister, girlfriend, boyfriend, etc., allowing users to receive support, comfort, and advice from the perspective of loved ones—even when those relationships are not available in real life. The second section offers professional personas like doctors, teachers, electricians, coders, astrologers, and more, giving users accurate and practical guidance instantly. Together, these two sections create a complete emotional + professional support ecosystem in one chatbot..*
